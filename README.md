# ATRT_project

This repository contains all code that has been used to analyse CRISPR-Cas9 screens in ATRT cells performed with the genome-wide knockout library Brunello.

These analyses include correction for gene-independent effects in CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens (CRISPRcleanR), hit calling using the gene essentiality classifier BAGEL2, and statistical analyses of depletion and enrichment using MAGeCK.

Further code describes analyses of chemogenetic screens of ATRT cells treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors. These screens have been performed both with a loss-of-function (Brunello) as well as a gain-of-function CRISPR library.
