# ATRT_project
Genetic dependencies of ATRT cells

This repository contains examplary code to analyse CRISPR/Cas9 screens performed with the genome-wide knockout library Brunello.

These analyses include correction for gene-independent effects in CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens (CRISPRcleanR), hit calling using the gene essentiality classifier BAGEL2, and statistical analyses of depletion and enrichment using MAGeCK.
